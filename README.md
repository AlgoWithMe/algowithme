# AlgoWithMe
## Purpose
Lucas: I keep going to these different sites leetcode, algoexpert.io, hackerrank and the like and they all forced me to interact with their website in clunky and sometimes even fustrating UIs. So I thought "what if you just used normal developer tools locally and used real development lifecycle processes to learn the algorithms: test locally, commit, push, PR, GitHub workflows?".
